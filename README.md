# PolarSteps-JSON2gpx-Parser
This script parses the GPS file from your exported Polarsteps data to a gpx 1.0 scheme.

This could be a helpful tool to you if you want to use the gps trackpoints from Polarsteps to automatically geotag your photos in Lightroom. 
Note that the script assumes your unix time stamps are in the GMT+0 time zone, therefore you may need to compensate for the time set in your camera. Lightroom has the option to do this.
